    "What Can You Do with Scikit-learn?\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a powerful tool for machine learning tasks, helping you analyze data and make predictions. Here's a simple breakdown of what you can achieve with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "This is about learning from labeled data (data with known outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression\n",
    "Predict continuous numbers, like house prices, temperatures, or sales.\n",
    "Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees (for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification\n",
    "Categorize data into groups, like spam vs. non-spam emails or healthy vs. sick patients.\n",
    "Examples: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "This is about finding patterns in data without labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering\n",
    "Group similar items, like grouping customers by behavior.\n",
    "Examples: K-Means, DBSCAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "Simplify data by reducing the number of features, making it easier to analyze or visualize.\n",
    "Examples: PCA, t-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Preparation (Preprocessing)\n",
    "Get your data ready for analysis by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling numbers to a consistent range.\n",
    "Handling missing values.\n",
    "Encoding text into numbers (e.g., one-hot encoding for categories).\n",
    "4. Model Evaluation and Improvement\n",
    "Model Evaluation\n",
    "Check how well your model works using metrics like accuracy (for classification) or error rates (for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning Parameters\n",
    "Adjust settings in your model to improve its performance (e.g., using Grid Search).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Combining Models (Ensemble Learning)\n",
    "Use multiple models together to make better predictions.\n",
    "Examples: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finding Outliers (Anomaly Detection)\n",
    "Detect unusual patterns, like spotting fraud in transactions.\n",
    "Examples: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Automating Workflows (Pipelines)\n",
    "Combine data cleaning, feature selection, and modeling into a single process to save time and ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Uses of Scikit-learn\n",
    "Predict sales or demand.\n",
    "Identify spam emails.\n",
    "Find groups of similar customers.\n",
    "Spot unusual activities like fraud.\n",
    "In Short\n",
    "Scikit-learn is like a toolbox for machine learning. It helps you clean data, build models, and find insights, making it easier to solve real-world problems."
